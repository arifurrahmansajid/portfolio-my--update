              <h3>
                A dedicated MERN stack Developer <br /> based in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

              </h3>
              <p>
                My programming journey began in University, where I was fascinated
                by how websites work. I started with basic HTML and CSS, and soon
                found myself building small projects for friends and family. Over the
                years, I expanded my skills to JavaScript, React, and the full MERN
                stack, always eager to learn new technologies and best practices.
              </p>
              <p>
                I enjoy working on interactive, user-friendly web applications that
                solve real-world problems. My favorite projects are those that
                challenge me to think creatively and collaborate with others. I thrive
                in team environments and love turning ideas into polished digital
                experiences.
              </p>
              <p>
                Outside of programming, I am passionate about football, painting, and
                exploring new places. I believe that creativity and curiosity drive
                innovation, both in code and in life. Whether I'm coding, playing
                sports, or creating art, I always bring energy and enthusiasm to
                everything I do.
